# mkg-minsoc
mkg-minsoc is a soc design learning tutorial for Hardware engineer or student.
Firstlys we all kown,A soc for users is :
  
  1、can run codes and have simple periperat

  2、have debug interface for users to debug codes or download codes

  3、codes can auto start 

In this tutorial I will build and introduce three architecture of soc based on openriscv2 from simple to complex which can compile these three function

  mkg-minsoc0:can cover the first function,can run codes and have simple periperat

  mkg-minsoc1:based on mkg-minsoc0 and added debug interface

  mkg-minsoc2:based on mkg-minsoc1 and can codes auto start 

##mkg-minsoc0
Here is the archtecture of it

mkg-minsoc based on openriscv2 has the follow charaacteristic:
